```

**Note:** Release ZIPs contain files at root (lib/, modules/, etc.), not in src/ subdirectory.

## Architecture

- **Static cache pattern**: Aliases, functions, env, and completions are concatenated into `cache/init.zsh` for fast loading (~5ms)
- **Dynamic tools**: Tool initializations (zoxide, fzf, thefuck, nvm, sdkman) contain evals and are loaded separately
- **Version-based regeneration**: Bump `VERSION` file to trigger cache rebuild

## Commands

- `st-reload` - Force cache regeneration and reload
- `st-version` - Show current version
- `st-info` - Show system information for debugging
- `st-update` - Check for and install updates
- `st-uninstall` - Clean removal with confirmation prompts

## Development

After editing any module in `src/modules/`:
1. Bump the version in `src/VERSION`, OR
2. Run `st-reload` in your shell

## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
make test                   # Run all Bats tests
bats tests/features.bats    # Run specific test file
```

### Version Management
```bash
make bump-patch            # Bump patch version (2.3.0 -> 2.3.1)
make bump-minor            # Bump minor version (2.3.0 -> 2.4.0)
make bump-major            # Bump major version (2.3.0 -> 3.0.0)
```

### Git Hooks
```bash
make hooks                 # Install pre-commit hooks
```

## Git Workflow & Pull Requests

**IMPORTANT**: PRs are merged using **squash and commit**. This means:
- All commits in a PR are squashed into a single commit on main
- The commit hash changes after merge
- **Never reuse a branch after its PR is merged** - it will have conflicts
- **Never push additional commits to a branch after creating a PR expecting it to be merged soon**

### Correct Workflow for Fixes/Features

1. **Always branch from latest main**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature  # or fix/my-bugfix
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**:
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "feat: description"
   ```

3. **Create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/my-feature
   gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
   ```

4. **After PR is merged**:
   - **DO NOT** push more commits to the same branch
   - **DO NOT** reuse the branch
   - For new work, create a NEW branch from main
   - Delete the old branch: `git branch -d feat/my-feature`

5. **For additional fixes/changes**:
   - If PR not yet merged: Can push to same branch (but avoid if possible)
   - If PR merged or will be merged soon: Create NEW branch from main

### Example: Making Two Separate Changes

❌ **WRONG** (will cause conflicts after first PR merges):
```bash
git checkout -b feat/feature-a
# work on feature A
git push -u origin feat/feature-a
gh pr create  # PR #1

# After PR #1 is merged, continuing on same branch:
git checkout feat/feature-a  # ❌ Don't do this!
# work on feature B
git push  # ❌ Will have conflicts!
```

✅ **CORRECT**:
```bash
# Feature A
git checkout main
git checkout -b feat/feature-a
# work on feature A
git push -u origin feat/feature-a
gh pr create  # PR #1

# After PR #1 is merged, start fresh:
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Get the squashed commit
git checkout -b feat/feature-b  # ✅ New branch!
# work on feature B
git push -u origin feat/feature-b
gh pr create  # PR #2
```

### Development Mode

When working on shell-tools, you can test changes without affecting your installed version:

**Auto-Detection**: The plugin automatically detects development mode when a `.dev` marker file is present.

- **In development** (git clone): `src/.dev` exists → dev mode active
- **When installed**: `.dev` excluded from release → normal mode

**Usage**:
```bash
# Test local changes
cd ~/projects/shell-tools
source src/plugin.zsh

# You'll see: [shell-tools] 🔧 Development mode active
# All subsequent logs will show: [shell-tools] [DEV] ...
```

**Isolation**:
- Dev mode uses `src/cache/` for cache files
- Installed version uses `~/.shell-tools/cache/`
- Both versions operate independently

**Workflow**:
1. Make changes to files in `src/`
2. Run `st-reload` to test changes
3. All commands (`st-version`, `use`, `g`, etc.) use local files

## Adding New Aliases/Functions

1. Edit the appropriate file in `src/modules/`
2. Run `st-reload` or bump `src/VERSION`

## Adding New Tools

1. Add tool name to `src/tools/required.txt`
2. If it needs initialization (eval), add to `src/modules/tools.zsh`
3. Run `st-reload`
